# ETL-Process-for-Edmund-Car-Reviews-data

I’ve used Edmunds Consumer Car Ratings and Reviews on Kaggle; it has 60 plus car brands and a lot of things inside the dataset where you can do a lot of data analysis work.
I’ve also used Genesis data because it’s simple and easy to process the data and practice.

The goal: Make an analysis based on negative reviews. In order to do that, Completing the proper ETL process will facilitate the SQL steps later on.
