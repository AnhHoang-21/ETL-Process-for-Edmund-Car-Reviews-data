 08/03/17,Rick ,2017 Genesis G90 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.3L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Traded my Lexus LS for a Genesis G90!," I've owned Lexus cars exclusively for the past 5 years, and had thought that I was a Lexus owner for life.  Over time, though, I have grown somewhat disillusioned by the direction Lexus has been heading, with much more edgy, showy, trendy styling and a significant decrease in the whole service/dealership/ownership experience.  I am an ""old-school"" Lexus lover -- the Lexus that is highly refined, elegant, understated, and rock-solid reliable.   The new Lexus has been designed to appeal to a younger audience, which is fine, but I wonder how many young people can afford a Lexus LS at $70+K...  So when it was time to give up my 2008 Lexus LS600hL, I decided to test drive the new Genesis G90.  All I can say was I WAS BLOWN AWAY!  Here was the ""old Lexus"" that I had been seeking!   The exterior styling was conservative but very classy (looks like it will age very well), and the interior styling was AMAZING!  From the super-soft and thick Nappa leather surfaces on everything I touch to the solid and well-designed switches (and they are everywhere!), I felt coddled by this car!  The safety amenities were comprehensive and all standard (radar cruise, heads-up display, blind-spot monitoring, pedestrian detection, surround-view camera, etc.).  The dealership experience was definitely sub-par, though, as I had to fight my way through the crowds lining up to lease Elantras for $99 per month, and the overall experience was no where near that of my Lexus dealer.  But what a car, and what a price!   And dedicated Genesis locations are being designed as we speak, and will significantly enhance the overall experience.  On the plus side, my salesman did everything he could to keep me from having to even come to the dealership.  He personally delivered my car to me along with the paperwork to sign.  For the next 3 years, he will bring me a G90 loaner any time I need service on my car, and will see that everything is done and my car delivered back to me at zero cost!  I chose to lease this car, as I was concerned with the high depreciation hit potential, but the lease price was very reasonable for a $71K car, and I will probably just get another new Genesis when this lease is up.  If you currently drive a Lexus LS, BMW 7-series, Mercedes S, or Audi A8, you owe it to yourself to take the G90 for a test drive.   This car will make a splash once it becomes more widely understood!",1,"Brand Loyalty Shift, Interior Features & Comfort, Customer Service, Dealership ",,

 07/02/18,Joe Margucci ,2018 Genesis G90 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl Turbo 8A),"""Acceleration failure"" - Genesis phraseology"," My 2018 G90 has an acceleration problems which the dealer and ""engineers"" at Genesis  acknowledge but will not  help with or repair.  Upon abrupt acceleration, like making a left turn in traffic, the car hesitates for three  terrifying  seconds before it lurches forward.  In addition when attempting to accelerate from a stop it is very hesitant to move forward when called upon.  I find this highly unsafe and infuriating.  The dealer told me quote "" WE were able to locate (on computer) the  acceleration failure you experienced.""  ""This is simply how  the car operates, new tech knowledge, ya know ?""  ""You are going to have to get accustomed to this idiosyncrasy of the car.""  The people at Genesis Customer Care, after 5 days of research, claim that their ""Engineers"" are aware "" of the hesitation problem"" and that is the way the car operates.  I was very unhappy and hired an attorney and am proceeding  on my journey> I want the car to go when I want it to.  Fair request?",3,"Safety Concerns, Vehicle Performance, Customer Service ",,
 06/02/18,Randy Terry ,2018 Genesis G90 Sedan Ultimate 4dr Sedan (5.0L 8cyl 8A),Nearest Thing To A Cruise Ship?," I found the conservative exterior design to be a little too conservative. If so, the interior made up for that very quickly. Rather than describe the interior as conservative, I would describe it as classic, and I mean that in the best possible use of the term. It was so opulent (in some ways) that I wondered during the test drive if it was a little TOO opulent. I am a gay man who loves fine dark wood antique furniture, so that is saying something. I haven't purchased one yet. I am not a fan of white nor the steel grey versions that the showroom had. I think the somewhat conservative exterior design would look better in black or a richer color. The lines of the car are really nice, even if unassuming. I drove the V8 top of the line, and the rear seating area was almost of limousine proportions where one could control most of the car from the back. I found myself thinking that this much effort on the rear compartment was a bit of a waste for a single man! But the V8 and rear wheel drive were a really nice combination. There was nothing mechanically I would be unhappy with. In a car like this. if you drive it the way this kind of car is meant to be used, I think most people would be very pleased with it. Without being as nit-picky as professional car reviewers are, I thought the fit and finish was very well carried off, and nothing in the interior switch gear, etc, stuck out as being cheap or substandard. My favorite thing about it all is that this really wonderful car has been brought to fruition by a company I wouldn't have sneezed at 20 years ago. I would be proud to drive a Genesis just because I like the idea of driving a wonderful car that IS NOT what everyone else out there is hankering for. It is quite a bit nicer than the first of the Lexus vehicles Toyota came out with.",4,"Exterior Design, Interior Features & Comfort, Driving Performance",,
 01/24/18,Robert Mojica ,2018 Genesis G90 Sedan Ultimate 4dr Sedan AWD (5.0L 8cyl 8A),2018 G-90 3.3T & 5.0 AWD," For the amount of money that is being asked for this car, I was not impressed at all..   First of all,  this car is a Hyundai , even though Genesis is trying to distance itself and separate from Hyundai, it may not happen for quite some time and, in my opinion, the depreciation on a new car in the luxury market without it's own branding will depreciate tremendously.  e.g.... To purchase this car, if you took out a loan  for $70,000.00 for 5 years, within in  3 years, you would owe more on the loan than what the car is worth.  The car is way overpriced.  Another strike against it is that the front end looks like a Chrysler 300.  Who in their right mind is going to pay $70,000 for a luxury car that looks like the Chrysler 300?  I currently own an Acura RL 2000 and the Bose audio in my car is way superior to the Genesis G-90 in my opinion.   I think you're on the right track. Genesis is a solid and comfortable car... has some good new features but you've priced it out of the market .... in my humble opinion...",3,"Pricing Concerns, Brand Perception, Depreciation Concerns, Exterior Design, Technology Quality",,

GOT ya""s"," dealer service every 3000 miles,change oil,check tires etc. Last service was told tires need replacing. Car only has 19,300 miles. They say tire warranty is with tire company Continnental. They now tell me normal tire wear is around 20,000 miles before replacement will be needed. So my wife puts around 20,000 per year to work and vacations. So I guess this means a new set of $1200.00 tires every 10 months. I have bought several new cars all have got at least 40,000 miles on the tires. I have called Genisis customer care and they wont even return my calls, I have sent at least 10 e-mails to customercare@genisis.com.

 05/16/17,Chris Lopez ,2017 Genesis G80 Sedan 3.8 4dr Sedan AWD (3.8L 6cyl 8A),Almost there!," A Lexus ES350 similarly equipped will cost less and have a much better shopping experience and resale value. Genesis needs stand alone dealerships to compete in the luxury space. However, it does look the best at its price but it takes a backseat in the refinement category. I highly encourage folks to test drive several in this category. You'll look at the Genesis on paper and think it should easily top the others. Driving them will show you why cars like this shouldn't be chosen based on specs alone. The quality of the material, how things actually work, road feel, resale, dealer experience and gas mileage are some items that prevented me from pulling the trigger.",4,"Dealer Concerns, Material Quality, Resale Value, Driving Experience",,
 03/24/17,w. wagner ,2017 Genesis G80 Sedan 3.8 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 8A),Extremely  Dissappointed," Drove this brand new car to 175 miles and the engine light came on. A message appeared on the navi screen saying that a fault had been detected and the car should be service immediately. Car went to the dealer who said the problem was a coil was bad. Replaced it. Took the car home and parked in the garage. Next day started car and it was worse than before. Shaking, rattling, open door and steering wheel vibrating. Back to the dealer. Told by a dealer service person that they were consulting with Hyundai technicians to determine the problem. They called and said it was a problem with the fuel injection and that a new one was ordered and would be put in the next day. Got a voicemail from the district parts and service manager for Hyundai out of Atlanta. He said in his message that he and a Hyundai engineer were coming to Florida to diagnose the problem with my car. I called him back and left him a message saying that the dealer had said it was a fuel injection problem. Seems to me the right hand doesn't know that the left hand is doing. As of this writing still do not have my car back nor do I have any communication from any one at the dealership or Hyundai. If Hyundai is trying to build Genesis into a luxury brand like Lexus they have a long, long way to go. Received a call from the dealer service dept. saying vehicle was fixed and was running fine. I asked when it was going to returned and they very politely asked that they keep it for another 6 days to that the engineers from Hyundai good diagnose it. Car wont be returned  until 03/29.",1,"Vehicle Reliability, Service Quality, Brand Perception ",,

 01/05/17,Susan ,2017 Genesis G80 Sedan 3.8 4dr Sedan AWD (3.8L 6cyl 8A),1st Vehicle in 15 years," I had put off purchasing a new vehicle, concerned about having to learn all the new technology.  Also, figured this will be my last car.    I wanted quiet, performance, easy to step in and out of and mid-size sedan.  In researching,  I was pretty sure the vehicle I wanted would be a Lexus ES350.  The Genesis was a slight bit quieter and only 3"" longer in reviewing specs but they classify it as a large vehicle.  The interior is quite roomy and felt more luxurious than the Lexus(not to mention the heated rear seats).  I felt more car for the price than the Lexus.  I don't feel like I am driving a bigger car.  Parking is easier than my old vehicle.  I really like the safety notification features especially cross traffic and blind spot notification.   Lane assist is pretty cool too.  As i am older, helps with bearings.  The only thing it is missing in my opinion would be auto trunk close.  I keep forgetting to lock it when I walk away but having the app available on my phone to check it is awesome.  Can start it or lock it from anywhere!  Plus, the 3 year maintenance and valet service is AWESOME! I didn't give it a 5 Star rating only because I had to go to mid grade in price for gas.  Also, having to have one of the sensors checked, keeps going off randomly when no other vehicle around so having to take it in already.   Amazing all the new stuff in 15 years(LOL).",4," Feature Limitations, Fuel Cost Considerations",,
 06/28/18,Kent ,2018 Genesis G80 Sedan 3.8 4dr Sedan AWD (3.8L 6cyl 8A),So many things I hate about this G80," Where to start.  When we first got this car the dealer couldn't get the tires balanced and had the car for over a week deciding what to do with it. Finally they replaced 3 tires claiming the road force too high on 3 of 4 tires. Why they didn't replace all 4 is beyond me.  The tires have always flat spotted badly so the first 15 miles Or so in lower temps were miserable. The flat spotting I believe has caused the Michelins to wear poorly which means a lot of road noise. I've had the tires rotated at each oil service but they have cupped badly.  The rear end whines from 45 mph down to about 25 when slowing down. The speed control loses 2-3 mph on a slight grade before catching a gear or two to get back up to speed.  The adaptive cruise won't let you get within a couple hundred feet of the car in front which means cars are constantly cutting in front and slowing the car.  There's no sensitivity setting for the adaptive cruise and you can't shut it off so you live with it or in my case I don't use it.  The front parking sensors work about every 10th time you drive the car, no rhyme or reason as to why or when they will work. The technology on this car would be fine if you wanted some Korean dude telling you how to drive but if you don't like it your stuck with it.  The G80 is a great looking car but It is the most annoying car that I have ever owned. Blows me away that there are so many 5 star ratings. Guess I just ended up with a turd. The dealer acted somewhat put out when we had the tire issue early on so with all the other problems I figured it was a waste of time trying to get them fixed. I received a couple quality surveys after I got the car and when I addressed the issues I was having the surveys stopped. Might explain so manY 5 stars. Cant wait to unload this pig.",2,"Tire Quality Concerns, Ride Quality, Performance, Adaptive Cruise Control Limitations, Sensor Reliability, Technology Limitations, Customer Service ",,
 05/25/18,Artie ,2018 Genesis G80 Sedan 3.8 4dr Sedan AWD (3.8L 6cyl 8A),Quiet and Luxurious," I purchased the G80 with premium package. If you want a beautifully styled car that performs well, is extremely comfortable and is incredibly quiet when you are enveloped in the luxurious cabin while costing thousands less than competitor's equivalent vehicles, this car is for you. If the nameplate of the brand is what drives your decision, Genesis is not for you. I say forget the shallow thinking since Lexus is a Toyota, Audi is a Volkswagen, Infiniti is a Nissan and Acura is a Honda. I also test drove the Audi A6 and Lexus GS 350. But, first I'll tell you about the Genesis G80. Since this is a pretty heavy car I was concerned about the power and pick up. So, I first test drove the G80 sport. The car weighs almost 4,700 pounds. With the 6 cylinder twin turbo and 365 horses this car is a beast. You hit the gas and it takes off. I was strongly considering it even though it was about $8,000 more than the G80 with premium package. Besides the bigger engine and sport suspension, the sport model includes the premium and ultra packages. My complaint was that I did not like the two tone seats and there is no option in the sport model to have a solid colored seat. I didn't feel I needed the Ultra package anyway which adds about $5,000 to the price. I then went out for a drive with the sales person in the G80 with premium package which also is a 6 cylinder 3.8 with a respectable 311 horses. This car weighs about 4,300 pounds (about 400 less than the sport). We only drove on local roads so I did not feel I got a good sense for what I was trying to find out and I had no more time. The sales person suggested I come back another day and take the car out on my own for a couple of hours which I did. I got onto the highway to test the pick up. While not matching up to the sport or that of the A6 or GS350, I found it more than acceptable with good passing ability. After all, I was not planning on racing the car. Next, I drove on some bumpy roads with pot holes. The G80 was magnificent. With some other cars I would feel every bump and jarring from the uneven pavement. The G80 took every bump in its stride. All the time I was driving I also could not believe how quiet the cabin was. You barely hear road noise or wind. Even the engine is so quiet at times I wasn't sure it was running. I found slightly more body lean taking curves at higher speeds than the A6 or GS350 but nothing appreciable. Also, if you put the car into ""sport"" mode it tightens up the steering and suspension which helps. It does come at a cost of a little poorer gas mileage however. Overall, I found this car a pleasure to drive with a very roomy and luxurious cabin. It also has loads of technology safety features included that some other brands charge additional for. The slight differences in performance between this and its competitors was not significant enough for me to rule out the G80. When the sales manager worked up the price for me and I saw it was $4,000 - $10,000 less than the competition, that clinched it. Genesis is doing everything right to make this a viable luxury brand. Even the 3 year concierge service. If your car needs servicing which by the way is included for the first 3 years, you don't have to bring your car in. They will bring you a loaner and take your car. When the service is finished they will return your car and take the loaner back.",2," Comfort & Ride Quality, Luxury Features, Technology & Safety",,
